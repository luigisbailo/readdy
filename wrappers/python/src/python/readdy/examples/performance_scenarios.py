"""
Measure the computation time of readdy and its sub-components for pre-defined scenarios.

## Some general ideas for comparing scenarios:

We define the following unit-less quantities (N,L,S,R), which will help to compare different scenarios:
- N ~ number of particles. For reactive systems this is the initial number of particles. Since we do measure for a few timesteps
  only, this is close to the average number of particles.
- L = V / h**3 ~ system size, i.e. fraction of system volume and the largest relevant lengthscale. For a cubic system V**1/3 would
  be the edge length of the box. With repulsing particles of radius r, the largest relevant lengthscale
  would be h=2r. V is the volume _accessible_ to particles. Note that h is the largest distance of two particles
  when an interaction has to be considered. Thus h can also be a reaction distance.
- S = sqrt(2*D*Delta t) / h ~ relative displacement of particles, fraction of distance traveled within
  one timestep (of width Delta t) divided by the largest relevant lengthscale. D is the largest diffusion constant.
  Usually S should be smaller than 1.
- R = k*Delta t ~ reactivity. When k is the largest reaction rate, R should usually be smaller than 1.

Derived from N and L can be the dimensionless density rho = N / L. When there is only a single relevant lengthscale h
or all lengthscales are narrowly distributed around h, the following statements apply:
- when rho = 1, the system is rather dense (every particle is assigned with a cube of volume h**3)
- when rho ~= 2, the system is closely packed (every particles is a sphere of radius h/2)
- when rho < 1, the system is dilute
- when rho >> 1, either lengthscales are widely distributed (then rho is ambiguous) or the system is ill-parametrized

There are different combinations of scenarios where our algorithms can scale very differently:
- Purely reactive system vs. purely collisive systemvs. both reactive and collisive
- Uniformly distributed vs. spatially separated
- Homogeneously sized particles vs. heterogene mixture

If you consider ONE system (fixed N and L) and want to compare different simulation algorithms with
varying timestep Delta t, then the simulation efficiency is of central interest:
- eta = simulated time / computation time ~ simulation efficieny

For example increasing the timestep would increase eta but R and S will also increase. If R or S come into range
of ~1, this hints towards a sampling problem.


## How the following performance scenarios work:

- Set of common variables along which to sample the performance, defined in 'factor_keys'
- Different methods: kernel, reaction_handler are given to scenario as parameters
- Scenario performs the system configuration and makes use of common variable factors, also runs the simulation
- Sampler that samples any scenario across any given variable (in form of factors from the base value)
